# Nagendra_Point_Cloud_correction

# Registration of point cloud with transformations from estimateAffine3D() follwed by ICP registration.
* Read airplane.ply file
* Sample the point cloud
* Apply pre-defined Transformation to the Sampled point cloud
* Estimate Transformation Pose from Transformed Point Cloud to Sampled point cloud using estimateAffine3D()
* Apply Inverse of Affine Transformation matrix to Transformed Matric
* This helps in overlap of Point Clouds
* Estimate Tranformation matrix from Affine transformed PC to Sampled PC using OpenCV's ppf_match_3d::ICP::registerModelToScene()
* Estimate Tranformation matrix from Affine transformed PC to Sampled PC using libpointmatcher's icp()
* Visualize
```
	- Sampled PC
	- Inverse Affine Transformed PC
	- Inverse OpenCV's ICP Transformed PC
	- Inverse libpointmatcher's ICP TRansformed PC
```
# ICP iterations for checking threshold of transformation.
* Computes all possible Pose matrices for a range of rotations and translations
* Transform the PC
* Estimate transformation pose matrix from OpenCV's ppf_match_3d::ICP::registerModelToScene()
* Compare (with some threshold), the Input Pose and the Pose that is estimated OpenCV's ppf_match_3d::ICP::registerModelToScene().
